<h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 font-sans border-b border-white/10 pb-2">1. Introduction</h2>
<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-400">This strategy utilizes a 50-period and 200-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover as the primary signal generator within the S&P 500 universe. The methodology is grounded in the Meta-Labeling framework established by Marcos López de Prado in <i>Advances in Financial Machine Learning</i> (2018). The primary model generates directional signals, while a secondary Bayesian Neural Network (BNN)—pioneered by researchers such as David MacKay (1992) and Radford Neal (1996)—acts as a sophisticated binary filter to determine trade execution based on probabilistic certainty.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 font-sans border-b border-white/10 pb-2">2. Methodology</h2>
<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-400">The strategy operates on daily bars with the capacity to scale into lower timeframes for execution refinement. The BNN meta-labeler utilizes an expanded feature set including volatility, RSI, volume, and trend-specific technical indicators such as S&P 500 Market Beta and historical price action. For labeling, the strategy employs a dynamic version of the Triple Barrier Method. A signal is labeled as 1 (success) if the price hits a profit target defined by a specific number of standard deviations (n⋅σ) above the entry, and 0 otherwise. This allows the model to adapt to varying market regimes by adjusting its "success" criteria based on local volatility.</p>

"By integrating BNNs, the algorithm leverages inherent uncertainty quantification to identify sideways markets where SMA crossovers are historically prone to whipsaws, while the use of volatility-normalized targets ensures the model scales its expectations with current market conditions."

<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-400">Current testing focuses on a 100% position sizing baseline to isolate the alpha generated by the BNN meta-labeling layer compared to a standalone SMA crossover. The long-term objective is to transition to dynamic position sizing, where the BNN's predictive variance directly dictates capital allocation, effectively "leaning in" to high-confidence trends while minimizing exposure during high-uncertainty periods.</p>
